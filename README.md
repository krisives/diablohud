
# DiabloHud

A tool that monitors your Diablo 2 save file and displays
your items on screen.


## What does it do?

It passively scans a directory for .d2s files and loads them
when they change and displays stats and items on screen for your
viewers!

## What is the "data" directory?

It contains item and mod information taken from the patch MPQs.

## Where is the d2s format described?

I have attempted to make the most up-to-date resource for this
in a GitHub repo called [d2s-format](https://github.com/krisives/d2s-format)

## Can I use your code in my project?

Yes simply include the LICENSE.md file text in your project.
